# AI Chatbot (LangChain + LangGraph)

This project is an AI-powered **Finance Chatbot** built with **LangChain** and **LangGraph**.  
It integrates an LLM API with contextual learning, finance-specific tools, and conversation orchestration.  
The chatbot supports **multi-threaded responses** for better concurrency and uses **LangSmith** for observability and debugging.
